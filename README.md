# Project name: 
iOS-FourSquareClone

# Description: 
A FourSquare clone App developed for educational purposes. Place name, place type, place atmosphere, place image and a pin on a map with the locaton of the place can be added to the app and then later viewed. When viewing a saved location, it is possible to tap on the location and get driving directions from the users current location. The driving directions are shown by the default app on a phone providing that service. Possibly lacking manyfeatures of the actual App but functional to a good extent.

# Installation:
The App has been tested with XCode 12.4 
Clone or download the project. 
Using the terminal change the directory to the location of the project
Type "pod install" and let the installation complete.
Open XCode, and open  "FourSquareClone.xcworkspace" and not "FourSquareClone.xcodeproj"
Run the App.

# Usage:
Signup using an email address and a password.
